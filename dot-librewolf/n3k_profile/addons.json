All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.

I noticed that all of the articles covering this topic mentioned that there was nothing you could do to prevent it... so I wanted to make one. After going down many rabbit holes, I found that this script which was port scanning everyone is, in my opinion, malware.\nHere's why I think that:\n\n    The data being exfiled from your computer is encrypted into an image using XOR.\n    The domain it reaches out to is made to look legitimate but redirects using a CNAME record to Lexis Nexis' servers.\n    It can determine your \"TrueIP\" even if you are using a VPN / Proxy. This is likely due to the aggressive fingerprinting.\n    The JavaScript is assembled via string.join (like malware often does) and then executed in a service worker.\n    Each time you load the page the JavaScript is re-obfuscated. This makes debugging what they are doing extremely difficult.\n    The script collects 416 pieces of personally identifiable information about you and your network. ( Shown HERE )\n    They talk about trying to bypass adblockers by using encryption in their customer onboarding documentation.\n\n\nSo I developed multiple ways to stop this. The first being the existing functionality built into Port Authority. By default, Port Authority will check the sites that your browser reaches out to and if it redirects to Lexis Nexis' infrastructure, it will be blocked and you will receive a notification. The second is a Python script I wrote which uses Shodan to find all of Lexis Nexis' customer-specific domains on the internet. You can add the output of the script to a blocker such as uBlockOrigin to prevent your computer from connecting to them.\n\nNote: This second method will never include every customer-specific endpoint so you are better off using the dynamic blocking built into Port Authority which WILL block every single customer-specific endpoint Lexis Nexis uses.\n\nReverse Engineering\n\nMost of these sites are using Lexis Nexis's Threat Metrix scripts, Dan Nemec has a great blog post reverse engineering the script and showing all the invasive data collected https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/\n\nZachary Hampton wrote some tools to reverse engineer the ThreatMetrix scripts.

The tab is coloured blue to indicate you are in the container.\nYou can log in and use Facebook as you normally do when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich features will not function on other websites?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook with your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook will still have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, block trackers and block third-party cookies, and use the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built into Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping and Banking whilst you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more on our support site.\n\nKnown issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set-up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/facebook-container/platform:2/addon-954390-latest.xpi. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit of extra care to ensure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue.
